Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Portfolio Project! 🚀
This end-to-end solution showcases my expertise in designing modern data architectures, building ETL pipelines, performing data modeling, and delivering actionable analytics using SQL Server and industry best practices.

🏗️ Data Architecture
This project follows the Medallion Architecture consisting of three layers:

🔸 Bronze Layer:
Raw data ingestion directly from CSV files (ERP and CRM systems) into SQL Server. No transformations applied.

⚙️ Silver Layer:
Cleaned, filtered, and normalized data. Applied deduplication, null handling, and standardized formats to prepare for analysis.

⭐ Gold Layer:
Business-ready star schema. Built dimension and fact tables optimized for analytical queries and reporting.

📖 Project Overview
This project includes:

Data Architecture: Designed using Draw.io to represent Bronze, Silver, and Gold flows.

ETL Pipelines: SQL Server-based scripts for extracting, transforming, and loading ERP and CRM data.

Data Modeling: Created star schema models with fact and dimension tables.
