Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Portfolio Project! 🚀

This end-to-end solution showcases my expertise in designing modern data architectures, building robust ETL pipelines, and performing data modeling using SQL Server, all aligned with industry best practices.

🔧 Note: This phase of the project focuses on building the Data Warehouse (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). Analytics and reporting will be implemented in future phases.

🏗️ Data Architecture
This project follows the Medallion Architecture consisting of three layers:

🔸 Bronze Layer:
Raw data ingestion directly from CSV files (ERP and CRM systems) into SQL Server. No transformations applied.

⚙️ Silver Layer:
Cleaned, filtered, and normalized data. Applied deduplication, null handling, and standardized formats to prepare for analysis.

⭐ Gold Layer:
Business-ready star schema. Built dimension and fact tables optimized for analytical queries and reporting.

📖 Project Overview
This project includes:

Data Architecture: Designed using Draw.io to represent Bronze, Silver, and Gold flows.

ETL Pipelines: SQL Server-based scripts for extracting, transforming, and loading ERP and CRM data.

Data Modeling: Created star schema models with fact and dimension tables.
